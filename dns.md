#### An Introduction to DNS Terminology

#### Domain Name System
The domain name system, more commonly known as "DNS" is the networking system in place that allows us to resolve human-friendly names to unique addresses.
#### Domain Name
A domain name is the human-friendly name that we are used to associating with an internet resource. For instance, "google.com" is a domain name. 
#### How DNS Works
The system is very simple at a high-level overview, but is very complex as you look at the details. Overall though, it is a very reliable infrastructure that has been essential to the adoption of the internet as we know it today.
#### Root Servers
What do these root servers do? Root servers handle requests for information about Top-level domains. So if a request comes in for something a lower-level name server cannot resolve, a query is made to the root server for the domain.There are currently 13 root servers in operation. However, as there are an incredible number of names to resolve every minute, each of these servers is actually mirrored.
#### TLD Servers
A TLD (top-level domain) is the highest level of domain names in the root zone of the DNS of the Internet. It operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and is responsible for maintaining the DNS root zone. DNS server which keeps all root zone is called TLD name server.
